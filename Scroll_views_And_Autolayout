Scroll view sets its content size based on objects droppped inside its content area.

So, if an image is dropped then scroll view can compute the content size required. But with textfields it does not work.

To work smoothly, everything inside the scrollview is first of all put in a uiview and then that uiview is put into the scrollview.
